# Backend-Server
Initial repo for all backend tasks


Latest Update: implemented text extraction using both pdfplumber as well as tesseract -> for text based(unscanned) pdfs, pdfplumber is better with 100% accuracy, whereas tesseract is also correct but not completely.                                                                                       -> for scanned pdfs, tesseract is better than pdfplumber but very low accuracy so no use
